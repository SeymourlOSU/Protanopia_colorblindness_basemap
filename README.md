Link included goes to my index.html for a map for those with Red-Green colorblindness.

there is also a geojson file for cites in oregon created manually at geojson.io

In relfecting on how i choose my theme i took inspiration from the example of color blindness and made it specific to someone i know that has red-green color blindness. I wasn't sure if i wasn't supposed to use the example or not but i was curious if i could make a map that actually made it easier for those with that specific colorblindess to intruprt the map as well as for anyone to use it. That being said I still have no idea if the map works for as i dont have this color blindness and i haven't gotten a hold of my friend.
